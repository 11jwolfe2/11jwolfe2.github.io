      <description>A short History of Land Cameras. So first, let me welcome you to the club! Old school Polaroid cameras are my favorite! I got my first 103 land camera in the summer of 2014 and since then I have aquired 20+ cameras. I have been taking instant film pictures as often as I can.
Polaroid is a company that was founded in 1931 by Edwin Land, the king of instant film!</description>

      <description>Something New and Something Old. This is probably the greatest thing to happen to instant film since the Impossible Project. A new camera with new integrated features, and the same great old school look we love from the original One Step. I recently bought a One Step 2, first to support Polaroid Originals as a company and movement and secondly because it is awesome! It is great at taking photos with less waste than other instant films, since it has a built in rechargable battery.</description>

      <description>So if you’re reading this article you might be thinking about changing your home to a smart home. So first let’s talk about what a smart home really is.
First a smart home is not anything like the Disney Movie Smart House, it will not attack you, it will not do things you don’t ask for and it certainly will not try to make itself human. A smart home is a house that can perform easy everyday tasks automatically or with other input.</description>
