      <description>Something New and Something Old. This is probably the greatest thing to happen to instant film since the Impossible Project. A new camera with new integrated features, and the same great old school look we love from the original One Step. I recently bought a One Step 2, first to support Polaroid Originals as a company and movement and secondly because it is awesome! It is great at taking photos with less waste than other instant films, since it has a built in rechargable battery.</description>
