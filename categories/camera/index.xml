      <description>Polaroid 80 Years of Cameras Pack Film -Land Cameras 100-400 Series Integral Film Integral FIlm is very different from pack film since the positive and negative are incorperated into one photo. This eliminates the need to pull the photo apart after a minute of fixing or so. Removes all needed skill in the development cycle.

      <description>A short History of Land Cameras. So first, let me welcome you to the club! Old school Polaroid cameras are my favorite! I got my first 103 land camera in the summer of 2014 and since then I have aquired 20+ cameras. I have been taking instant film pictures as often as I can.
Polaroid is a company that was founded in 1931 by Edwin Land, the king of instant film!</description>

      <description>Something New and Something Old. This is probably the greatest thing to happen to instant film since the Impossible Project. A new camera with new integrated features, and the same great old school look we love from the original One Step. I recently bought a One Step 2, first to support Polaroid Originals as a company and movement and secondly because it is awesome! It is great at taking photos with less waste than other instant films, since it has a built in rechargable battery.</description>
