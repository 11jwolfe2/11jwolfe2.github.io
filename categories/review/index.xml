      <description>The New OneStep 2 So it has finally happened! A new Polaroid Camera!! This is an exciting time! If you are a fan of analog photos this is a tall tale sign that they are here to stay.
My OneStep 2 Since the release of the OneStep 2 I have wanted one bably! So I finally purchased one a few weeks back. I was hopeful someone would of gifted it to me over the holidays but no luck.</description>
