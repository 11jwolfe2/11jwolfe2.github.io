      <description>A short History of Land Cameras. So first, let me welcome you to the club! Old school Polaroid cameras are my favorite! I got my first 103 land camera in the summer of 2014 and since then I have aquired 20+ cameras. I have been taking instant film pictures as often as I can.
Polaroid is a company that was founded in 1931 by Edwin Land, the king of instant film!</description>

      <description>Something New and Something Old. This is probably the greatest thing to happen to instant film since the Impossible Project. A new camera with new integrated features, and the same great old school look we love from the original One Step. I recently bought a One Step 2, first to support Polaroid Originals as a company and movement and secondly because it is awesome! It is great at taking photos with less waste than other instant films, since it has a built in rechargable battery.</description>
